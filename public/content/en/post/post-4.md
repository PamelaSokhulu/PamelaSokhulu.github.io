Forget downloading third-party apps for scanning documents! Open the Notes app, start a new note, tap the camera icon, and select “Scan Documents.” It’s simple and effective.

To extend your battery’s lifespan, enable *Optimized Battery Charging* under *Settings > Battery > Battery Health.* Your iPhone learns your charging routine to reduce battery aging.

Adjust your audio volume in smaller increments by holding the volume button while dragging the slider on the screen. It’s great for achieving that perfect balance.



**8. Share Wi-Fi Passwords Seamlessly**

Press and hold the spacebar on the keyboard to enter trackpad mode. You can move the cursor precisely through text, making editing a breeze.
