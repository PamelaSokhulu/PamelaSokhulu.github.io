With iOS 11 in 2017, Apple introduced ARKit, allowing developers to create augmented reality experiences. iOS 12 enhanced performance on older devices and introduced Screen Time for monitoring device usage.</p>
<p><strong>9. Dark Mode and Privacy Focus (iOS 13-14)</strong><br>
iOS 13 brought Dark Mode, a long-requested feature, while iOS 14 introduced Home Screen widgets and App Library for better organization. Apple also doubled down on privacy with features like App Tracking Transparency.</p>
<p><strong>10. iOS Today: A Hub of Innovation</strong><br>
iOS now powers devices like the iPhone, iPad, and even the Apple Watch. With each update, Apple continues to refine its ecosystem, adding features like Live Text, Focus modes, and advanced security measures to keep users connected and protected.</p>
